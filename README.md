# Snoopy
## OSINT project

### Goals
1. Find some tutorials, existing projects, etc and look at what's currently being done in osint (Good place to start might be http://www.automatingosint.com/blog/)
2. Decide where/how to execute scripts (While not illegal, we can get into poking around on the dark web. So you don't want your own machine, username, etc floating around too much)
3. Follow an interesting tutorial and start to execute some stuff on a target. See what we get back.
4. See if you can take the output of the first exercise, run it through another osint resource, and get more back.
5. Rinse and repeat
